- __Class Schedule__

  - This part of the site shows the users a table with the class schedule. Top rows are colored to spot the days easily and each cell features the difficulty of the class and time.
  - Users would check their corresponding class schedule here and get updates on it.

### Features Left to Implement

- Idea is to have the dance cards on the main page clickable with the hover effect.
- This would lead the user onto the separate page for each dance with more info, pictures and videos.

- Dropdown menus in the registration form for selections like male or female dancer and current skill level.
